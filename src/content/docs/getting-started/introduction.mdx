## What is GreenKube?

**GreenKube** is an open-source **FinGreenOps** tool designed to help DevOps, SRE, and FinOps teams **measure, understand, and reduce** the carbon footprint and costs of their Kubernetes infrastructure.

It combines **FinOps** (financial optimization) with **GreenOps** (environmental sustainability) into a unified platform that provides:

- **Real-time monitoring** of energy consumption, CO₂ emissions, and costs per pod, namespace, and node
- **Actionable recommendations** to reduce both cloud bills and environmental impact
- **Regulatory compliance** support for CSRD/ESRS E1 carbon reporting requirements
- **Historical analysis** with flexible time ranges and data export capabilities

## The Problem

Cloud computing is responsible for approximately **2-4% of global CO₂ emissions** — comparable to the airline industry. As organizations scale their Kubernetes infrastructure, they face two mounting challenges:

### 1. Regulatory Pressure (CSRD)
The EU's **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)** requires companies to report the carbon footprint of their entire value chain, including cloud services (Scope 3). Without proper tooling, estimating the carbon impact of Kubernetes workloads is nearly impossible.

### 2. Cost Inefficiency
Studies show that **30-40% of cloud spending is wasted** on idle, oversized, or poorly optimized resources. This waste translates directly into unnecessary carbon emissions.

## The Solution

GreenKube addresses both challenges simultaneously by:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="1. Estimating Energy">
    Calculates per-pod energy consumption (Joules) using Prometheus metrics and cloud instance power profiles based on the Cloud Carbon Footprint methodology.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Tracking Carbon">
    Converts energy to CO₂e emissions using real-time grid carbon intensity data from Electricity Maps, with region-specific accuracy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Optimizing Resources">
    Identifies optimization opportunities — zombie pods, oversized workloads, autoscaling candidates — with estimated savings in both cost and CO₂.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Reporting">
    Generates detailed reports by pod, namespace, and time period in formats compatible with CSRD/ESRS E1 requirements.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Who Is It For?

| Role | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **DevOps / SRE** | Monitor cluster efficiency, identify wasteful workloads, right-size resources |
| **FinOps** | Optimize cloud costs with visibility into per-workload spending and recommendations |
| **Sustainability / CSR** | Generate carbon reports for CSRD compliance, track emission reduction progress |
| **Platform Engineers** | Deploy a self-hosted monitoring stack with Helm, integrate with existing Prometheus/OpenCost |
| **CTOs / Engineering Managers** | Get high-level dashboards showing cost and emission trends across the organization |

## Key Concepts

### FinGreenOps
GreenKube introduces the concept of **FinGreenOps** — the convergence of:
- **FinOps**: Financial management and optimization of cloud costs
- **GreenOps**: Environmental sustainability and carbon footprint reduction

By combining these disciplines, teams can make decisions that are both **cost-effective** and **environmentally responsible**.

### Energy Estimation
GreenKube estimates energy consumption using:
- **CPU utilization metrics** from Prometheus
- **Cloud instance power profiles** (min/max watts per vCPU) based on the [Cloud Carbon Footprint](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/) methodology
- **Dynamic power modeling** that accounts for idle and active power components

### Carbon Calculation
The carbon emission formula is:

```
CO₂e (grams) = Energy (kWh) × Grid Intensity (gCO₂e/kWh) × PUE
```

Where:
- **Energy** is calculated from CPU utilization and instance power profiles
- **Grid Intensity** comes from Electricity Maps API (real-time) or a configurable default
- **PUE** (Power Usage Effectiveness) accounts for datacenter overhead (cooling, networking, etc.)
