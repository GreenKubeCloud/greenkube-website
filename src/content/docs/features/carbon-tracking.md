title: Carbon Tracking
description: Convert energy consumption to CO₂e emissions using real-time grid carbon intensity data, supporting CSRD/ESRS E1 reporting.
---

GreenKube's carbon tracking converts your Kubernetes cluster's **energy consumption into CO₂ equivalent emissions** using real-time electricity grid carbon intensity data.

## The Problem

The EU's **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)** requires companies to disclose the carbon footprint of their entire value chain — including cloud infrastructure (Scope 3). Most organizations have no visibility into the emissions generated by their Kubernetes workloads.

## How It Works

### 1. Energy Estimation
GreenKube estimates the power consumption of each pod using a combination of:
- **CPU utilization** × node TDP (Thermal Design Power)
- **Memory utilization** × per-GB power coefficient
- **GPU utilization** × GPU TDP (when applicable)
- **Network and disk I/O** power overhead

### 2. Carbon Zone Mapping
Each node is automatically mapped to a **carbon zone** based on its cloud provider and region. GreenKube includes built-in mappings for:
- AWS (all regions)
- Google Cloud Platform (all regions)
- Microsoft Azure (all regions)
- OVH Cloud
- Scaleway

### 3. Carbon Intensity
GreenKube fetches **real-time carbon intensity** (gCO₂/kWh) from [Electricity Maps](https://www.electricitymaps.com/) for each carbon zone. This means your emissions tracking reflects the actual energy mix of the grid powering your workloads.

### 4. Emissions Calculation

```
CO₂e (grams) = Energy (kWh) × Carbon Intensity (gCO₂/kWh)
```

This is computed per pod, aggregated per namespace, and rolled up to the cluster level.

## CSRD / ESRS E1 Compliance

GreenKube helps you meet **ESRS E1** (Climate Change) disclosure requirements by providing:

| Requirement | GreenKube Feature |
|---|---|
| Scope 3 emissions (cloud) | Per-pod CO₂e calculation |
| Historical data | Time-series storage with configurable retention |
| Audit trail | Immutable metric snapshots with timestamps |
| Reporting formats | CSV, JSON export; API access |
| Methodology transparency | Open-source estimation models |

## Configuration

To enable real-time carbon intensity, set your Electricity Maps API token:

```yaml
# Helm values.yaml
electricityMaps:
  enabled: true
  token: "your-api-token"
```

Without a token, GreenKube falls back to **static carbon intensity averages** per country — still useful, but less accurate.
